# Landscape Analysis and Modeling

#Instructor: Michael L. Treglia

## Course Description:
Understanding spatial relationships across landscapes can provide critical insight into evolutionary and ecological patterns and processes, ultimately necessary for biodiversity conservation. This course will focus on quantifying spatial relationships, using spatial interpolation techniques to estimate environmental variables at unmeasured points, and modeling connectivity across landscapes.  The course will take advantage of powerful free and open source software for GIS and statistical analyses.

Things to be included in Course Description:
* Theory/background: 
* What students should expect to learn
* What tools will be used



## Time and Location:

TBA
