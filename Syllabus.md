# Landscape Analysis and Modeling

#Instructor: Michael L. Treglia

## Course Description:
Understanding spatial relationships across landscapes can provide critical insight into evolutionary and ecological patterns and processes, ultimately necessary for biodiversity conservation. This course will focus on quantifying spatial relationships, using spatial interpolation techniques to estimate environmental variables at unmeasured points, and modeling connectivity across landscapes.  The course will take advantage of powerfull free and open source software for GIS and statistical analyses.
