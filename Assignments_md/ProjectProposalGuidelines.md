***Due Date: Thursday, 29 March 2016***


For this class, you are required to complete a project that involves some sort of geospatial analysis or working with geospatial data. A proposal for this project is due on 29 March 2016, which should outline the data you have, the general questions you are trying to answer (with background information on the questions), general methods you might use, and hypotheses/expected results from this work.

This proposal should be 1-3 pages single spaced (6 pages double-spaced is okay), excluding any citations, figures, and tables. You should have at least 5 references to the scientific literature (peer-reviewed journals articles and books/book chapters; No online-only sources like Wikipedia). If you need clarification on these guidelines, please meet with the instructor. You may include any supporting tables or figures as needed.

The overall goal of this assignment is to formally outline your project, so the instructor can work with you to clarify any issues and develop appropriate analyses. This proposal is worth 10% of your final grade. Don't be nervous about putting your ideas down - be excited about getting your ideas down on paper so we can build on them to make an interesting project.

Contact the instructor with any questions, or to discuss potential analyses and ideas as you think them through for this proposal.
