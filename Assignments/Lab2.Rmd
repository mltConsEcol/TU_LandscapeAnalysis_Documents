[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is a powerful, free platform for statistical computing, and has become commonly employed in countless fields in the last decade. It is largely command-line driven, however, which creates a learning curve. This document and the exercises within is designed to give new users some familiarity with the program. Users can interface directly with R, or work with [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/), which some people find makes it easier to stay organized within a session of R.

To install R on your own computer, look for the download links here: [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/), and follow the respective instructions. To install RStudio, find the download button at the RStudio homepage, here: [http://www.rstudio.com/](http://www.rstudio.com/).

## Getting Started with R

Start by opening up the lastest version of R installed on your computer. You'll see a screen that may look a bit daunting, with a single window that has text in it and a blinking cursor. It should look something like this:

This is where you can type commands directly into R, and see immediately what R has done with your commands. There are two main ways to work with R:

1) Interactively, within this window; and 
2) Via scripting, using R Script files.



Things to cover:
1) R as a calculator
2) Defining data in R (create vectors and dataframes)
3) Importing .csv files in R
4) Calculating summary statistics
5) Making basic plots
2) 

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
