# Access for Ecologically-relevant GIS Datasets

Though many studies use various spatial/GIS datasets, finding and working with them can be a bit of a mystery to a GIS newcomer. This document is designed to point users in the right direction to get started, with a focus on the United States (though some datasets discussed here are also available for other parts of the world). The resources listed below are not necessarily mutually-exclusive to one-another (i.e, you can often find some of the same datasets at multiple places), though some datasets may only be availalbe from individual sources.

## Some Things to Pay Attention To

When accessing GIS Data, there a


## National-Scale Data

### The National Map

[The National Map](http://nationalmap.gov/) is kind of a one-stop-shopping location for lots of datasets that are distributed by the U.S. Government. These include vector layers of political boundaries, hydrologic data including stream networks and watershed boundaries from the [National Hydrography Dataset](http://nhd.usgs.gov/), and roads. These layers are typically available for download as shapefiles or geodatabase files. Raster datasets that are available include elevation (digital elevation models [DEMs]) from the [National Elevation Dataset](http://ned.usgs.gov/), land cover classifications from the [National Land Cover Database](http://www.mrlc.gov/), and aerial imagery.

To view what is available and download available datasets, use [The National Map Viewer](http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/) platform. Upon opening the webpage, you will see something similar to the image below. Browse around this page - hover your mouse over the icons just above the the map to see what they do, and expand the lists of layers on the left by clicking the + and - icons next to the categories. Check and un-check the boxes to see what these data look like. In the Map, zoom in and out.

## State GIS Resources (for Oklahoma)

Most states have their own repositories for GIS data. Typically when I'm trying to find such a repository, I do a Google search for something along the lines of these phrases: "[Insert State Name] GIS Data"; "[Insert State Name] GIS Repository"; "[Insert State Name] GIS Warehouse"; or "[Insert State Name] GIS Clearinghouse". Here are also a couple of websites that list some resources available by state:

* [Tulsa City-County Library GIS resources (http://guides.tulsalibrary.org/content.php?pid=557423&sid=4599537)](http://guides.tulsalibrary.org/content.php?pid=557423&sid=4599537)
* [Carleton College webpage from theNational Association of Geoscience Teachers (http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/gis/state_resources.html)](http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/gis/state_resources.html)

For Oklahoma, a couple of particular websites that can be useful are are:
