# Sources for Ecologically-relevant GIS Datasets

Though many studies use various spatial/GIS datasets, finding and working with them can be a bit of a mystery to a GIS newcomer. This document is designed to point users in the right direction to get started, with a focus on the United States (though some datasets discussed here are also available for other parts of the world). 


# The National Map

[The National Map](http://nationalmap.gov/) is kind of a one-stop-shopping location for lots of datasets that are distributed by the U.S. Government. These include vector layers of political boundaries, hydrologic data including stream networks and watershed boundaries from the [National Hydrography Dataset](http://nhd.usgs.gov/), and roads. These layers are typically available for download as shapefiles or geodatabase files. Raster datasets that are available include elevation (digital elevation models [DEMs]) from the [National Elevation Dataset](http://ned.usgs.gov/), land cover classifications from the [National Land Cover Database](http://www.mrlc.gov/), and aerial imagery.

To view what is available and download available datasets, use [The National Map Viewer](http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/) platform. Upon opening the webpage, you will see something similar to the image below. Browse around this page - hover your mouse over the icons just above the the map to see what they do, and expand the lists of layers on the left by clicking the + and - icons next to the categories. Check and un-check the boxes to see what these data look like. In the Map, zoom in and out.

## Downloading Data from The National Map

Though it can be somewhat informative to simply view data in The National Map Viewer, you'll inevitably want to download it for manipulation and analysis.
