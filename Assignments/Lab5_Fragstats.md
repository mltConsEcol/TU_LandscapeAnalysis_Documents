#Part 1: Analyzing Categorical Rasters using FRAGSTATS

##Introduction

This assignment involves a few steps, which involve doing some pre-processing of categorical raster datasets, and loading them into and analyzing them in [Fragstats](LINK). 

We will use data from the [2011 National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD)](LINK), for a couple of areas near Tulsa, OK. The NLCD is available at 30 meter resolution, for the entire United States; multiple layers are available for this, including categorical land cover data, percent canopy cover and percent impervious pavement per pixel. These data are available for download via both the [Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC)](http://www.mrlc.gov/) and [The National Map Viewer and Download Platform](http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/).

For this lab, we will start with a 3 x 3 degree tile of the categorical NLCD layer for north-eastern Oklahoma, which includes part of Tulsa. I have made this available on the Harvey website for the course (in the Week 6 Lab folder) and at [this](LINK) link, but it can also be downloaded from the sources noted above. Before we get into doing actual analyses, we will go through a few pre-processing steps, often necessary in setting up the analyses we are going to go through.
